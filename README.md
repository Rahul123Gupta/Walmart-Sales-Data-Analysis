🏪 Walmart Sales Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Walmart’s sales data to uncover valuable business insights and identify key factors that influence sales performance. It demonstrates my skills in Data Analytics, EDA, and Visualization using Python.

📖 About the Project

I built this project as part of my Data Analytics and Data Science learning journey to understand how large retail companies like Walmart use data to make strategic decisions. The goal was to explore the data, identify sales trends, and derive actionable insights.

📊 Key Highlights

Performed Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Pandas & NumPy

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find sales patterns

Analyzed the impact of holidays, temperature, fuel price, and CPI on weekly sales

Created visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn to present insights clearly

Used Statistical Analysis to identify correlations and seasonal trends

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains historical sales data from Walmart stores, including store information, weekly sales, dates, holidays, and external factors like temperature and fuel prices.

💡 Insights Found

Certain holidays (like Christmas and Thanksgiving) show higher sales peaks

Economic factors such as fuel price and CPI slightly affect store performance

Some stores consistently outperform others due to location and size differences

🚀 Future Enhancements

Build a predictive model to forecast future sales using machine learning

Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Tableau

Add store-level performance comparison reports

🧠 What I Learned
